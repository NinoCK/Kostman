# Authentication Token Issue Fix

## Problem Summary

You were experiencing a 419 CSRF token error and 401 authentication errors when logging out, which required a page refresh to work properly. The same issue was happening with the login page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a **race condition** during the logout process:

1. **User clicks logout** → Session invalidation begins
2. **Frontend components** (like EnvironmentSelector) try to make API calls to endpoints like `/api/collections`
3. **API library** attempts to refresh CSRF token by calling `/sanctum/csrf-cookie`
4. **Session is already invalidated** → Results in 401/419 errors
5. **User sees error messages** and logout appears to fail

This race condition occurred because:
- The EnvironmentSelector component was making API calls during page transitions
- The API library was trying to get fresh CSRF tokens for every request
- During logout, the session gets invalidated but components were still active

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Logout State Management (`/resources/js/lib/api.ts`)

```typescript
// Global flag to prevent API calls during logout
let isLoggingOut = false;

// Global abort controller for canceling requests during logout
let globalAbortController: AbortController | null = null;

// Function to set logout state
export function setLoggingOut(loggingOut: boolean) {
    isLoggingOut = loggingOut;
    
    // Cancel all pending requests when starting logout
    if (loggingOut && globalAbortController) {
        globalAbortController.abort('User is logging out');
        globalAbortController = null;
    }
    
    // Create new abort controller when not logging out
    if (!loggingOut) {
        globalAbortController = new AbortController();
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced API Request Handling

- **Prevents API calls during logout** - No requests are made when `isLoggingOut` is true
- **Graceful error handling** - Cancelled requests don't show error messages
- **AbortController integration** - All requests can be cancelled immediately during logout
- **Smart CSRF handling** - Doesn't try to refresh CSRF tokens during logout

### 3. Updated Logout Function (`/resources/js/layouts/postman-layout.tsx`)

```typescript
const handleLogout = () => {
    // Set global flag to prevent API calls during logout
    setLoggingOut(true);
    
    router.post('/logout', {}, {
        forceFormData: true,
        onSuccess: () => {
            // Redirect will be handled by the server
        },
        onError: (errors) => {
            console.error('Logout error:', errors);
            // Reset the flag if logout fails
            setLoggingOut(false);
        },
        onFinish: () => {
            // Reset the flag when logout process is complete
            setLoggingOut(false);
        }
    });
};
```

### 4. Component Error Handling (`/resources/js/components/EnvironmentSelector.tsx`)

Enhanced error handling in API-consuming components to gracefully handle cancelled requests:

```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
    // Don't show errors for cancelled requests
    if (error?.message === 'API calls are disabled during logout' || error?.name === 'AbortError') {
        return;
    }
    
    console.error('Failed to create environment:', error);
    setError('Failed to create environment. Please try again.');
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `tests/Feature/LogoutTokenTest.php` to verify:
- ✅ User can logout successfully
- ✅ CSRF token regeneration during logout
- ✅ Proper handling of session invalidation

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Eliminates race conditions** - API calls are prevented during logout
2. **Improves user experience** - No more confusing 419/401 errors
3. **Clean error handling** - Cancelled requests don't spam console
4. **Robust session management** - Proper cleanup of pending requests
5. **Future-proof** - Handles any new components that might make API calls

## Configuration Verification

Your Laravel configuration was already correct:
- ✅ Sanctum `EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful` middleware properly configured
- ✅ API routes protected with `auth` middleware
- ✅ Session driver set to `database`
- ✅ CSRF tokens properly shared via Inertia

## How to Test the Fix

1. Login to your application
2. Navigate to any page with API components (dashboard, collections, etc.)
3. Click logout
4. The logout should work immediately without any 419 errors
5. Try the same with login page - should work smoothly

The fix ensures that during the logout process, all API calls are cleanly cancelled and no authentication errors are shown to the user, providing a smooth logout experience.
